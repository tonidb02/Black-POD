The application aims to **assist GITI (Industrial Engineering Degree) students in organizing their schedules** by accepting a set of conditions and desired subjects, then suggesting all possible combinations that match these preferences.

The conditions students can add are quite varied: from specifying times during the week when they prefer not to have classes, to prioritizing certain lecturers for specific subjects. Selected subjects may be from different years in case students have pending subjects.

Ultimately, the goal is to **expand the functionality of the official POD** (Academic Organization Project) of ETSII-UPM, thereby enhancing students' organization and optimizing their time.
